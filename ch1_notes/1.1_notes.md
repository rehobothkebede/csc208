# Key Concepts:

1. Mathematical Statments:
    - Definition: A mathematical **statment**, or **proposition**, is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both.
    
    - Examples:
        - "The sum if two even number is even" (True)
        - "7 is a prime number" (True)
        - "The square root of 2 is a rational number" (False) 

### Logical Connectives
Logical connectives combine statements to form compound statements.

- **Negation** ($\neg p$): Inverts the truth value.
- **Conjunction** ($p \land q$): True if *both* $p$ and $q$ are true.
- **Disjunction** ($p \lor q$): True if *at least one* of $p$ or $q$ is true.
- **Implication** ($p \rightarrow q$): False only if $p$ is true and $q$ is false.
- **Biconditional** ($p \leftrightarrow q$): True if $p$ and $q$ have the same truth value.
