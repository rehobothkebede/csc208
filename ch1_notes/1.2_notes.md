# Key Concepts:

## 1. Implication

**Definition:** An **implication** (or **conditional**) is a molecular statement of the form:

$ A \rightarrow B $

where $A$ and $B$ are statements. We say that:

- $A$ is the **antecedent** (or **hypothesis**),
- $B$ is the **consequent** (or **conclusion**).

    An implication is **false** only when $A$ is true and $B$ is false; in all other cases, it is true.
