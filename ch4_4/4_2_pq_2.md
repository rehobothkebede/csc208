## Problem


Your sisterâ€™s summer job pays her $1000 per week, with a raise of 5% per week as a bonus for not being a quitter. How much will she make in the 10th week?

## Answer 


This is a *geometirc sequence*, where: 


- First term $a_{0} = 1000$


- Commen ratio $r = 1.05$ (because she gets a 5% raise each week)


We want to find how much she earns in the 10th week $a_{9}$.


The formula of the $n$th term of a geometirc sequence is:


$$ a_{n} = a \cdot r^{n-1} $$


So the 10th week is: 


$$a_{10}$$


Plug in vlaues to the formula: 


$$ a_{10} = 1000 \cdot (1.05)^{9} $$


$$ (1.05)^{9) \approx 1.551328 $$


$$ a_{10} \approx 1000 \cdot 1.551328 = 1551.33 $$

$$ \boxed{1551.33} $$
