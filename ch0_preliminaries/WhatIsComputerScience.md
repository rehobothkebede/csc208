# What is Computer Science?

Computer Science blends logic, mathematics, and engineering but lacks empirical observation, making it more akin to philosophy. 

## The Philosophical Nature of CS
- Focuses on logic over experimentation.
- Early CS was empirical but shifted to mathematical formalisms.
- Models reality rather than explaining phenomena.

## Influence of Mathematics
- Introduced abstractions like algorithmic complexity.
- Prioritizes theoretical over real-world performance.

## Risks of Pure Logic
- Research often lacks empirical validation.
- Logical conclusions may contradict real-world data.

## Conclusion
CS is best seen as applied philosophy, leveraging logic while recognizing its limits.
