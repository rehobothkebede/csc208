# Solution to the Golf Foursomes Problem


## Problem Statement


On a business retreat, your company of 24 businessmen and businesswomen goes golfing.  
You need to divide up into foursomes (groups of 4 people): a first foursome, a second foursome, and so on. How many ways can you do this?


After all your hard work, you realize that in fact, you want each foursome to include one of the 6 Board members. How many ways can you do this?

## Part 1: Dividing 24 People into Labeled Foursomes


We want to split 24 people into 6 labeled groups of 4. Because the groups are labeled (first, second, etc.), the order of the groups matters.


### Step-by-Step Breakdown:


We select 4 people for each group in order. This gives us:


$$
\binom{24}{4} \cdot \binom{20}{4} \cdot \binom{16}{4} \cdot \binom{12}{4} \cdot \binom{8}{4} \cdot \binom{4}{4}
$$


Now expand each combination:


\[
= \frac{24!}{4! \cdot 20!} \cdot \frac{20!}{4! \cdot 16!} \cdot \frac{16!}{4! \cdot 12!} \cdot \frac{12!}{4! \cdot 8!} \cdot \frac{8!}{4! \cdot 4!} \cdot \frac{4!}{4! \cdot 0!}
$$


All the intermediate factorials cancel out, leaving:


### Final Formula:


$$
\frac{24!}{(4!)^6}
$$


We do **not** divide by \(6!\) because the groups are labeled.

## Part 2: Each Group Includes One Board Member


Now we want each of the 6 groups to include exactly one of the 6 Board members. That means:


- Assign each of the 6 Board members to one of the 6 labeled groups â†’ \(6!\) ways
- For each group, pick 3 more people from the 18 remaining (non-Board) people


### Step-by-Step Breakdown:


$$
\binom{18}{3} \cdot \binom{15}{3} \cdot \binom{12}{3} \cdot \binom{9}{3} \cdot \binom{6}{3} \cdot \binom{3}{3}
$$


Expand each:


$$
= \frac{18!}{3! \cdot 15!} \cdot \frac{15!}{3! \cdot 12!} \cdot \frac{12!}{3! \cdot 9!} \cdot \frac{9!}{3! \cdot 6!} \cdot \frac{6!}{3! \cdot 3!} \cdot \frac{3!}{3! \cdot 0!}
$$


Which simplifies to:


### Final Formula:


$$
6! \cdot \frac{18!}{(3!)^6}
$$


We multiply by \(6!\) because each Board member is distinct and can be assigned to any of the 6 labeled groups.

## Final Answers


1. Number of ways to divide 24 people into 6 labeled groups of 4:


$$
\boxed{\frac{24!}{(4!)^6}}
$$


2. Number of ways to divide 24 people into 6 labeled groups of 4 with one Board member per group:


$$
\boxed{6! \cdot \frac{18!}{(3!)^6}}
$$
