# Solution to the Golf Foursomes Problem


## üèåÔ∏è Problem Statement
On a business retreat, your company of 24 businessmen and businesswomen goes golfing.  
You need to divide up into foursomes (groups of 4 people): a **first** foursome, a **second** foursome, and so on. How many ways can you do this?  

After all your hard work, you realize that in fact, you want each foursome to include **one of the 6 Board members**. How many ways can you do this?

## Part 1: Dividing 24 People into Labeled Foursomes


We want to split 24 people into 6 **labeled** groups of 4 (since the question says ‚Äúfirst foursome, second foursome‚Ä¶‚Äù). That means **group order matters**.


### Step 1: Total Arrangements of 24 People
The total number of ways to arrange 24 people is:
$$
24!
$$


### Step 2: Adjust for Unordered People Within Each Group
We divide by \(4!\) for each group to ignore internal order:
$$
(4!)^6
$$


### Do NOT divide by 6!  
Group order matters here, so we **do not divide by \(6!\)**.


### Final Formula
The correct number of ways is:
$$
\frac{24!}{(4!)^6}
$$

## Part 2: Each Foursome Must Include One Board Member


We now want each group of 4 to include **1 distinct Board member** (6 total), and **3 of the remaining 18 people**.


### Step 1: Assign Board Members to 6 Groups
There are 6! ways to assign 6 distinct Board members to 6 labeled groups:
$$
6!
$$


### Step 2: Divide Remaining 18 People into Groups of 3
We divide 18 regular people into 6 groups of 3. Order within each group doesn't matter **but group labels do**, so we use:
$$
\frac{18!}{(3!)^6}
$$


### Step 3: Multiply Both Parts Together
Multiply to get the total number of valid groupings:
$$
6! \cdot \frac{18!}{(3!)^6}
$$

## Final Answers


1. **Number of ways to divide 24 people into 6 labeled groups of 4**:  
   $$
   \boxed{\frac{24!}{(4!)^6}}
   $$


2. **Number of ways with one Board member in each group**:  
   $$
   \boxed{6! \cdot \frac{18!}{(3!)^6}}
   $$
